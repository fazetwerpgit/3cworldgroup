# RESUME — read this and continue without being asked

This file is auto-injected at session start. It is the live state of the
portal redesign campaign. Resume the "NEXT ACTION" immediately; do not ask
the user to re-explain or to point you at docs.

Updated: 2026-07-13 (update this file at EVERY milestone: pick made, page
started, implementation done, deploy — not just at session end).

## NEXT ACTION

Calls HYBRID APPROVED by user 2026-07-13
(design-mockups/calls-round2/hybrid-the-line-calls.html). Fixes applied
during verify: weekday case-mismatch ("UNDEFINED" everywhere), card clock
numerals clipped ("10:0" → resized per breakpoint), hero "2" numeral
ink-chopped by background-clip box (padding/margin paint-area fix +
line-height .78, top-aligned with headline). Committed. NOW: FORMS mockup round in flight.
Inventory done (5 native forms: fiber-report, expedite-order,
payroll-dispute, leads-request, manager-interview; all share one pattern;
no forms landing page exists). USER APPROVED adding a Forms home page
(hub listing all 5) 2026-07-13. 3 mockups BUILT + verified + SENT 2026-07-13 in
design-mockups/forms-round1/ (option-1-form-desk, option-2-paper-trail,
option-3-the-line-forms), each = hub view + payroll-dispute fill view
with a fixed top-right view toggle. Fixes applied during verify: view
toggle moved below header (was overlapping header meta in all 3), opt-2
mobile headline overflow (13vw→11vw), 1px mobile overflow from numeral
paint-fix padding (mobile override padding-right:0). GOTCHA: PowerShell
Get-Content -Raw + Set-Content corrupts UTF-8 (mojibake) — fixed via
1252→UTF8 byte round-trip; use [IO.File] with explicit UTF8 for bulk
edits. Screenshots: forms-opt{1,2,3}-{hub,fill}-{1440,390}.png at repo
root. PICK MADE: option-3 The Line: Forms (committed 6317004) with changes:
(a) counts as plain numbers — NO LEADING ZEROS (new campaign-wide rule:
masthead numerals and stat counts show 5 not 05), (b) form fill must be
genuinely better-organized — numbered sections (who you are / what
happened / proof) + tidy segmented choice-picker pattern (this pattern
will later fix the messy carrier/plan buttons in the sale form; user
called current forms 'a jumble'). Round-2 BUILT + verified + SENT
(design-mockups/forms-round2/the-line-forms-final.html): plain 5s,
numbered fill sections (who you are / what happened / proof),
segmented campaign picker with dependent sub-row (the pattern that
will fix Log a Sale's carrier/plan jumble at Sales implementation).
Fix during verify: mobile h1 13vw→10.5vw (clipped after 05→5 made the
line longer). WAITING user confirm → commit forms-round2 + spec scope
update → next page: SIDEBAR + portal shell (new round 6 per expanded
scope), then RESOURCES (University+Links merge — propose with mockups,
needs user approval).

NOTE design rule added: the big metallic count numeral in mastheads is
top-aligned with the headline (applies to every future page mockup).

## Campaign state (mockups-first, implement later)

User direction: run ALL pages' mockup rounds first, one page at a time,
3 mockups each; implement + 1:1 verify + deploy later, per page, when the
user says so. The user is non-technical — plain language, business
decisions only, one question at a time.

Picks so far (all "The Line" family — dark Spotlight Arena):
- Dashboard: option-3 The Line — IMPLEMENTED locally (commit 05cb166,
  parity PASS), deploy PARKED. Not pushed.
- Sales: option-3 The Line: Sales — picked 2026-07-13, not implemented.
  Approvals page folds into Sales pending view (user-approved merge).
- Team Chat: option-3 The Line: Chat — picked 2026-07-13, not implemented.
  Includes mobile fix: visible ⋯ on own bubbles → action sheet (replaces
  buggy long-press).
- Calls Schedule: HYBRID picked+approved 2026-07-13 (calls-round2/
  hybrid-the-line-calls.html), not implemented.
- Forms: IN PROGRESS (mockup round).
- SCOPE RULING (user, 2026-07-13): EVERY portal page gets the redesign,
  including the sidebar/nav shell itself, form-options, chat-channels,
  user management, email-templates — everything. Full inventory in the
  campaign spec §Page order (10 rounds). Remaining after Forms:
  Sidebar+shell → Resources (University+Links merge candidate; +shorts,
  pay-structure) → Member pages (settings, onboarding, signup) →
  Ops/admin queues → Admin management. Leaderboard DONE/deployed — never
  touch.

## Standing rules (do not re-ask)

- Dark-first everywhere; light mode stays working as a toggle.
- Merges/structure changes: flag plainly + get user approval BEFORE mocking.
- Implementation gate per page: goal contract → Codex implements → fresh
  Opus 1:1 screenshot-verify until EXACT (not close enough) → gates
  (tsc/eslint/build/diff-check) → user says "deploy" → push (push = prod).
- Mockup process: Codex (gpt-5.6-luna) builds from a self-contained brief;
  screenshot 1440 + 390 (390 first-class); self-critique; send numbered
  options as files; user picks or mixes.
- Orchestration: main loop judges; Codex executes; Opus verifies; subagents
  never on Fable; keep main-loop context lean (delegate reads).
- Verification recipe: dev server usually already on :3000 (check before
  starting another); automation browser stays signed in as the user; dark
  via localStorage 3c-theme; API mocks via page.route with REAL field names
  (leaderboard: {leaderboard, currentUser, totalRanked}; stats: {stats:{...}}).
